# Résumé and Portfolio

Collection of (mostly) static pages that make up my résumé site at <http://keithsmiley.net/>. "Mostly" because it uses a touch of PHP for includes. Responsive design on a fluid grid, and maybe another buzzword.

Built with some tools I'd never used before but will definitely use again:

* [Golden Grid System](https://github.com/jonikorpi/Golden-Grid-System)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
* [Photo Swipe](http://www.photoswipe.com/)

## TODO

* Revisit the approach for responsive images. Currently using the [noscript method](http://www.headlondon.com/our-thoughts/technology/posts/creating-responsive-images-using-the-noscript-tag) but should try [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill).
* Update front page be responsive using LESS stylesheet.
* Try to refactor more of `resume.less` and `projects.less` into `base.less`.
